# 💻 EOC Assignment 4 – Elements of Computing Systems
This repository contains the implementation for Assignment 4 of the subject Elements of Computing Systems. It focuses on designing and simulating key digital logic components using a minimalist hardware description style inspired by the Nand2Tetris curriculum.

# 📁 Repository Contents
->HDL-style logic modules implemented as .m files

->Custom-built logic gates and combinational components:

 * AND, OR, NOT gates

 * Multiplexers (2:1, 4:1, 8:1)

 * Demultiplexers (1:2, 1:4)

 * Adders (Half Adder, Full Adder, 4-bit Adder)
